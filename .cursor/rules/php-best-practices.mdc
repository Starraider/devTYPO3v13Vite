- Use object-oriented programming principles to enhance modularity and reusability.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and files for better readability.
- Implement assertions to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.
- Handle potential edge cases in logic implementations to ensure robustness.
- Maintain compatibility with specified PHP versions and TYPO3 requirements.
