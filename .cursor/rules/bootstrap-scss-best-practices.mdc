- Leverage Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts using container, row, and column classes.
- Utilize Bootstrap components (e.g., buttons, modals) to enhance user experience without extensive custom CSS.
- Apply Bootstrap's utility classes for quick styling adjustments.
- Ensure all components are accessible; use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- Customize Bootstrap's Sass variables and mixins for a unique theme without overriding defaults.
- Use Bootstrap's responsive utilities to manage visibility and layout across devices.
- Keep custom styles minimal; prefer Bootstrap's classes for consistency.
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming classes of components
- Avoid !important; use specificity to manage styles.
